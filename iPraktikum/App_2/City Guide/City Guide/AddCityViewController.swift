    // Task 5: To add a new city the AddCityViewController should be used, that is already connected with the other elements of the UI using Bar Button Items. Create a UI using labels, text fields (and slider, segmented controls or picker if you feel comfortable with it).

    // Task 6: The user should enter all the information that is stored in an instance of City on this screen and you should validate his input so that only correct data is entered.
    // A state should be located in the country that is entered
    // When a number is expected only a number should be accepted and when a string is accepted only a string should be stored in the model
    
    // Task 7: If a user has entered wrong information when he pressed the save button, inform him with a UIAlertView describing the wrong input.
    
    // Task 8: You only need to offer the possibility to validate 3 countries with 2 states each in your validation logic. Use computed properties and extensions when implementing the validation. Unknown countries, states and parties can be denied. (Normally not a good practice but acceptable for this example ðŸ¤“)
